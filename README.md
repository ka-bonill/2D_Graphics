# Graphics Museum
Premise: 

The 2D Graphics Museum is meant to be an aesthetically pleasing walkthrough through a variety of the different capabilities P5 JS has to offer. User interaction is provided through one of the galleries (Choose 3D), as well as in Hypnotize. 

Game Play:  

Depending on the gallery, a user must interact with the screen to produce a unique image. The gallery itself will provide instructions to output an animation. The home page provides links to each respective gallery, a simple click on each link will direct a user to the correspoding gallery page. 

Tech Choices: 

I learned P5 JS my sophomore year for the class N220. I remember the class fondly as I learned a lot of the fundmentals of JavaScript and things like DOM manipulation. This project pays homage to that class, as well as gave me the opportunity to revisit P5. P5 is a wonderful animation library, which made me want to further explore its capabilities. I can definitely say that was the case with this project. For hypnotize, please click on screen to get shapes to appear.

Lessons Learned:  

One of the most difficult obstacles I came across for this project was the actual ideation portion. I knew I wanted to create something visually pleasing, but beyond that initial sentiment it was important to narrow down to a more concrete concept. What helped me do this was to reflect on animations I had seen before and what I liked about them. An additional obstacle was due to a rotation issue I had with a 3D object. Rotating more than one 3D project proved to be more difficult than expected. To resolve the issue required modifying my looping function and adjusting the rotation parameters.
